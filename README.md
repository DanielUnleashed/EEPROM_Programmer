# EEPROM_Programmer
 
The title is self-explanatory: yes! Another EEPROM tool made to read from, check and write to. The circuit revolves around an Arduino NANO whose pins have been wired to the common
layout of an EEPROM (tested on a 28C256). The PC communicates over Serial with the Arduino and vice-versa. There's not much to it... It's all console based, so you just have to call
the program and it will generate the file prompt window in case you want to upload a binary file (.hex only).
